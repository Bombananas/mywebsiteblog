    As I first started, i didn't know anything, 
    so i started to google the thing i didn't know.
    First i start watching tutorial, 
    some of which are no help but still i thur.
    As I was "me" i didn't do anything of value, 
    so sometimes I would be motivated and sometimes not.
    I didn't keep any journal to document my mistake or solution, 
    so I would stuck in a loop of remembering and forgorring.
    <div><!--Don't know how to make a saparat line of text.--></div>
    I hope this's reach a lot of people and if you see any mistake in the code or grammar please contact me, 
    as i would like to improve.
    Thank you very much for reading my blog!!!
