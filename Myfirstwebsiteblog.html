    As I first started, i didn't know anything, so i started to google the thing i didn't know.
First i start watching tutorial, some of which are no help but still i thur.
As I was "me" i didnt do anything of value, so sometimes I would be motivated and sometimes not.
I didn't keep any journal to document my mistake or solution, so I would stuck in a loop of remembering and forgorring.

    I hope this's reach a lot of people and if you see any mistake in the code or gammar please contact me, as i would like to improve.
